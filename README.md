# Show/hide collections with your keyboard like you did in Blender 4...

In Blender 5 you can no longer use 1-0 on your keyboard to show/hide collections. You now need to hover over the outliner in stead of over the 3D viewport. I couldn't get used to this and have created this addon.

Get this addon to:

Show / hide collections
- press 1, 2, 3.. to see only see that collection
- press SHIFT + 1, 2, 3.. to show / hide that collection
- press ~ to show all collections

Enable / disable collections in your render
- press ALT + , 2, 3.. to render only see that collection
- press ALT + SHIFT + 1, 2, 3.. to enable / disable rendering that collection
- press ALT + ~ to render all collections

Select collections
- press 1, 2, 3.. to select that collection

You can enable/disable these three options in the sidebar of your 3D viewport.
