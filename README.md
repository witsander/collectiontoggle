# Show/hide collections with your keyboard like you did in Blender 4...

In Blender 5 you can no longer use 1-0 on your keyboard to show/hide collections. You now need to hover over the outliner in stead of over the 3D viewport. I couldn't get used to this and have created this addon.

Get this addon to:

- press 1-0 on your keyboard to only see that collection
- hold shift to also show/hide that collection
- press ~ to show all collections
- hold alt to enable/disable rendering collections

Enable 'Toggle select' to also select a collection with keyboard 1-0.
